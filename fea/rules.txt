Rules of Engagement - The FEA races

0. Rules of the game

1. Point system

2. Prizes and punishment (PP)


0.  Very simple. Declare your non-structure variables in a short preamble. 
Before the first calculation, or matrix assembly, declare tic function.

toc must be superceded with an fprintf() function that prints the answer or a plot(),
function depending on what is the required answer.

1. ---

2. Losers agree to be subject to unusual punishment. This unusual punishment for now is 
the compulsory use of inclusive language in dialogue (and in monologue, soliloquoys, etc.)
for the duration of a whole day (24hs).

for example: "The men are angry" translates as "Les hembres estan enojades".
